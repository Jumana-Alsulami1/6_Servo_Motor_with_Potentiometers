6 Servo Motor with Potentiometers

This task involves the control of six servo motors using six potentiometers. 


The Arduino circuit :

The potentiometers with the Arduino:

1- Right end of all potentiometers with the 5V on the breadboard.

2- Left end of all potentiometers with GND on the breadboard.

3- Middle pin of all potentiometer with Pins A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 on the Arduino.

The servo motors with the Arduino:

1- The power wires of all servos with the 5V on the breadboard.

2- The GND wires of all servos with the GND on the breadboard.

3- The signal wires of all servo with the digital pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 on the Arduino.



Write the Arduino Code.
